# Arduino and Loom Setup Guide

## IDE Setup

### **Install the Arduino IDE** 

- Get and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- Follow Adafruit's [instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-basic-proto/overview) on how to:
  - Add the Adafruit boards index
  - Install Adafruit boards
    - Make sure to install the Adafruit SAMD Boards
  - Install drivers if on Windows 7

### **Download the Loom Library from GitHub**

- Go to the [InternetOfAg](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/InternetOfAg) folder on GitHub (one directory above this one)

- Click the green 'Clone or Download' button, and 'Download Zip'

- Unzip the downloaded file

### **Install the Loom Dependencies**

**Mac/Linux**

Either: *(assuming InternetOfAg folder was downloaded to Downloads folder and is unzipped)*

- Find the 'extract_libraries.sh' script from the 'Arduino_and_Loom_Setup' folder from the InternetOfAg download
- Open Terminal
- Drag the script onto the Terminal window
- Press Enter

Or:

- Find the 'Dependencies' folder in the InternetOfAg folder
- Select all of the zip folders
- Right-click and 'Open With' an installed zip extracting application (like Unarchiver)
- Once all of the zip files have been extracted as folders, drag them all to the folder: `Documents/Arduino/libraries ` 

**Windows**

- Find the 'Dependencies' folder in the InternetOfAg folder
- Select all of the zip folders
- Right-click and use 7zip or equivalent to extract the folders
- Once all of the zip files have been extracted as folders, drag them all to the folder: `Documents/Arduino/libraries ` 

### **Optional Configuration**

#### **Using an External Editor**

The Arduino IDE editor is a bit limited, so if you want to use a different editor to modify your code, open the Arduino IDE preferences and check the 'Use External Editor' checkbox. This puts a blue tint over the code, and prevents it from being edited in the IDE. Instead, open up your preferred editor to modify your code - anytime you save in that editor, the code in the IDE should update.

**Note â€“** you will still need to use the IDE to compile and upload your code to the devices 

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a great editor you might consider.
